    <h1>Magic Kingdom</h1>

 

<p>Disney World is probably most associated with the Magic Kingdom park, as it is probably the first park that comes to mind when you think about Disney World. It is home to the famous Cinderella Castle and Disney's staple ride, It's a Small World After All. When you walk into Magic Kingdom you are hit by Environmental Characteristics, placed specifically to make guests feel like they are actually on a Main Street in USA. The smells walking down the Street are nothing but delicious. Smells come wafting from the popcorn stands and ice cream stores, and your senses are sure in for a treat. Below is a picture of me and my brother near the entrance of the Magic Kingdom!</p>

<p>There is also social value found in Magic Kingdom as some of the best character meet and greets are held here. In this park you can find your any of your favorite characters. Although not my favorite park, Magic Kingdom is perceived as the best over the others because of its iconic attractions and experiences. Below you can see me meeting one of my favorite princesses, Cinderella!</p>
